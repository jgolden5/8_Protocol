# 8 Protocol (8P): 8 rules to recursively define 8 Protocol
## 8 Principles which drive 8 Protocol
__1: Near-sighted brain:__
  
 _Problem: When coding, we usually tend to overestimate how much our brains can process and remember at one time. The result is usually that instead of spending our brainpower solving the problem at hand or exponentially improving our efficiency through clever optimization solutions (like this one ;), we must instead spend a large fraction of our brainpower remembering why the flip we made a 52-line function that does 4 different things, or get lost trying to find a simple function in a bloated codebase._
  
_Solution: Limit as many aspects of my project to '8' as possible. 8 functions, 8 projects, 8 modules. 8, 8, 8!_
